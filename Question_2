I love to keep learning about the new products or services that are being shipped or released in order to assist our customers to provide with the latest information about the products and how it could assist them in their business to keep growing using our products.
I love to collaborate with different teams (R&D, Engineering, Sales) and learn about their team's current issues with the support organisation and work with them to improve the shortcomings and make communications between teams streamlined and easier.
In my free time, I like to dwell on one topic that I am not familiar or fluent in (it can be anything, a new technology , certification, language) and schedule sometime every week to become fluent in in such a way that I could then share the knowledge with others.
