I would not describe those tasks as my most or least favorite, but I would rather classify them as per the priority I would assign each one of them (top-most being the highest, bottom being the lowest)
Here is the list as per my priority:
1) Act as a dedicated CSE for a handful of key customers to ensure their success using Vercel
2) Work with engineering teams during incidents and provide updates to internal and external stakeholders
3) Manage a support team
4) Dig through logs to troubleshoot a customer's broken project
5) Analyze hundreds of support tickets to spot trends the product team can use
6) Identify, file (and, where possible, resolve) bugs in private and public Vercel/Next.js repos on GitHub
7) Work with the product team to develop a new feature based on feedback from customers
8) Write and maintain support articles and docs pages
9) Engage multiple users at once in a public discussion, to answer their questions and troubleshoot problems
10) Find and recruit teammates for the support team
11) Work with people to figure out if Vercel is suitable for their use case
12) Help train and onboard new support teammates
13) Run ticket review sessions to make sure tone is consistent
14) Work with 3rd party partners to track down a tricky situation for a joint customer
15) Scheduling time-off coverage and collaborating as part of a growing cohesive support team
16) Create video tutorials to help teach users a specific feature or use case
17) Respond to queries on Twitter, Reddit, Hacker News and other 3rd party sites
18) Help resolve billing issues for customers
