It was an internal technical article at my current company that left a lasting and positive impression on me. When I was interviewing for the role at my current organisation, I was skeptical of joining because there was no support team in the US and I was going to be the first support engineer supporting ~30 customers with their intgeration queries, issues and incidents. Before Onfido, I was part of a big support team where all the support processes were established and I was just part of the team doing my "Job". I decided to join the organisation because I wanted to learn about the Identity Verification domain and also gain expertise in Coding and Client libraries. When I started working, my first day, I worked on 4 tickets, all so different from the other, that I almost learned about the team responsible for several different products, and played around with the API myself, that I became comfortable since then. One fine day, I came across this article (https://medium.com/onfido-tech/the-team-behind-tech-support-at-onfido-1d47cdd1a6d8), and especially the section "What impact do you make across the business?", was when I was so impressed that I started to push myself to learn about all the different products and all the tasks to support not only external stake holders, but our internal stake holders. If anyone asks me why I love support, I always say "Tech Support is at the heart of our product." and I love to make our customers happy.
